        the operating system can move its data to swap space
      - hibernate: save memory to disk
      - enable allocation memory more than physical capacity
    shared: memory segment multiple processes can access
    buff/cache: cache segment to speed up access to disk files and block devices
    swap memory doesn't have shared, buff/cache fields for its nature
    h: human readable format  
  free -s 2
